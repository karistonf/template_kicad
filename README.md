# Template Kicad

Some templates that are very useful for developing PCBs in KiCad

The components in the template include:

* A symmetrical power supply with an input of 5 volts and outputs of +12 volts and -12 volts.
* Can (Controller Area Network) module
* A buck power supply with an input of 12 volts and an output of 3.3 volts.
* A microcontroller, the STM32F103, featuring a High-speed external (HSE) crystal, a Low-speed external (LSE) crystal for the RTC, a 3.3V battery backup for the RTC, power indicator LEDs, a USB connector, and a programming connector with a JST jack.
